Frontend Software Engineer with a proven ability to deliver quality results in both solo and collaborative settings. Prior to transitioning to software development, I worked in public health during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The same passion I have for inclusivity and collaboration, I also have for software development. Embracing this passion led me to work through 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp, which focused on JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I am now eager to apply these passions in obtaining a challenging position on a collaborative development team focused on creating high-quality, intuitive front-end applications.
